Project 51, niNety-nniinE BoOttels: Display the lyrics to a repetitive song that get more distorted
with each verse.
Manipulate strings to introduce distortions.

In this version of the song "Ninety-Nine Bottles", the program introduces small imperfections in
each stanza by either removing a letter, swapping the casing of a letter, transposing two letters,
or doubling a letter.
As the song continues to play, these mutations add up, resulting in a very silly song. It's a good
idea to try Project 50, "Ninety-Nine Bottles," before attempting this one.
