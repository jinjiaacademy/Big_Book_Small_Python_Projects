"""
Project 66, Simple Substitution Cipher: An encryption scheme more advanced than the Caesar cipher.
Perform intermediate math on text.

The Simple Substitution Cipher substitutes one letter for another. Since there are 26 possible
substitutions for the letter A, 25 possible substitutions for B, 24 for C, and so on, the total
number of possible keys is 26x25x24x23x...x1, or 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 keys! That's
far too many keys for even a supercomputer to brute force, so the code-breaking method used in
Project 7, "Caesar Hacker" can't be used against the simple cipher. Unfortunately, devious attackers
can take advantage of known weakness to break the code.
