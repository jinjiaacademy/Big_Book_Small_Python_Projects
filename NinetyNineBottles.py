Project 50, Ninety-Nine Bottles: Display the lyrics to a repetitive song.
Use loops and string templates to produce text.

“Ninety-Nine Bottles” is a folk song of undetermined origin known for its length and repetitiveness.
The lyrics go,
“Ninetynine bottles of milk on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of milk.
Take one down, pass it around, ninety eight bottles of milk on the wall.”
As the lyrics repeat, the number of bottles falls from ninety-eight to ninetyseven, then from
ninety-seven to ninety-six, until it reaches zero: “One bottle of milk on the wall, one bottle
of milk. Take it down, pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall!”
Luckily for us, computers are excellent at performing repetitive tasks, and this program reproduces
all of the lyrics programmatically. An extended version of this program is in Project 51,
“niNety-nniinE BoOttels.”
