Project 78, Trick Questions: A quiz of simple questions with misleading answers.
Parse the user's text to recognize keywords.

What does a yellow stone thrown into a blue pond become? Do they have a 4th of July in England?
How can a doctor go 30 days without sleep? Whatever you think the answers to these trick questions
are, you're probably wrong. The 54 questions in this program have been specifically crafted so that
their answers are simple, obvious, and misleading. Finding the true answer will require some cleverness.
Copying the code from this book will spoil the fun, since you'll see the answers, so you might want
to download and play this game from https://inventwithpython.com/trickquestions.py before looking at
the source code.
