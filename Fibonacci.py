Project 26: Finonacci: Generate numbers in the famous Fibonacci sequence.
Implement a rudimentary mathematics algorithm.

The fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical pattern credited to Italian mathematician
Fibonacci in the 13th century (though others had discovered it even earlier). The sequence
begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers.
The sequence continues forever:
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ......
The Fibonacci sequence has applications in music composition, stock market prediction, the
pattern of florets in the head of sumflowers, and many other areas. This program lets you
calculate the sequence as high as you are willing to go. More information about the Fibonacci
sequence can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence
