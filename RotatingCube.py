Project 62, Rotating Cube: A rotating cube animation.
Learn 3D rotation and line drawing algorithms.

This project features an animation of a 3D cube rotating using trigonometric functions.
You can adapt the 3D point rotation math and the line() function in your own animation
programs.
Although the block text characters we'll use to draw the cube don't look like thin, straight
lines, this kind of drawing is called a wireframe model because it renders only the edges of
an object's surfaces. Figure 62-1 shows the wireframe model for a cube and an icosphere, a
rough sphere made of triangles.
