Project 55, Powerball Lottery: Simulate losing at the lottery thousands of times.
Explore probability using random numbers.

The Powerball Lottery is an exciting way to lose small amounts of money. If you purchase a $2 ticket,
you can pick six numbers: five drawn from 1 to 69, and a sixth "Powerball" number drawn from 1 to 26.
The order of the numbers doesn't matter. If the lottery selects your six numbers, you win $1.586 billion
dollars. Except you won't win, because your odds are 1 in 292,201,338. But if you spent $200 on 100
tickets, your odds would be ... 1 in 2,922,013. You won't win that either, but at least you'll lose 100
times as much money. The more you like losing money, the more fun the lottery is!
To help you visualize how often you won't win the lottery, this program simulates up to one million
Powerball drawings and then compares them with the numbers you picked. Now you can have all the excite-
ment of losing the lottery without spending money.
Fun fact: every set of six numbers is just as likely to win as any other. So the next time you want
to buy a lottery ticket, pick the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Those numbers are just as likely to
come up as a more complex set.
