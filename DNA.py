Project 21, DNA Visualization: An endless ASCII-art double helix that demonstrates the structure
of DNA.
Work with string templates and randomly generated text.

Deoxyribonucleic acid is a tiny molecule that exists in every cell of our bodies and contains
the blueprint for how our bodies grow. It looks like a double helix (a sort of twisted ladder)
of pairs of nucleotide molecules: guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. These are represented
by the letters G, C, A, and T. DNA is a long molecule; it's microscopic, but if it were stretched
out, its 3 billion base pairs would be 2 meters long. This program is a simple animation of DNA.
