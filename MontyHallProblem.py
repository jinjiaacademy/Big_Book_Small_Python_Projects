Project 48, Monty Hall Problem: A simulation of the Monty Hall game show problem.
Examine probability with ASCII-art goats.

The Monty Hall Problem illustrates a surprising fact of probability. The problem is loosely
based on the old game show Let's Make a Deal and its host, Monty Hall. In the Monty Hall Problem,
you can pick one of three doors. Behind one door is a prize: a new car. Each of the other two
doors opens onto a worthless goat. Say you pick Door #1. Before the door you choose is opened,
the host opens another door (either #2 or #3), which leads to a goat. You can choose to either
open the door you originally picked or switch to the other unopened door.
It may seem like it doesn't matter if you switch or not, but your odds do improve if you switch
doors! This program demonstrates the Monty Hall problem by letting you do repeated experiments.
To understand why your odds improve, consider a version of the Monty Hall Problem with one thousand
doors instead of three. You pick one door, and then the host opens 998 doors, which all reveal goats.
The only two doors that are unopened are the one you selected and one other door. If you correctly
picked the car door to begin with (a 1 in a 1000 chance), then the host left a random goat door closed.
If you picked a goat door (a 999 in a 1000 chance), the host specifically chose the car door to leave
closed. The choice of which doors to open isn't random; the host knows to leave the car door closed.
It's almost certain that you didn't pick the car door to begin with, so you should switch to the other
door.
Another way to think of it is that you have 1000 boxes and one box contains a prize. You guess which
box the prize is in and the host puts it in your hands. Do you think the prize is in your box or one
of the 999 other boxes? You don't need the host to open 998 of the 999 boxes that don't contain a prize
the amount of choice is the same as with the 1000 doors. The odds that you guessed correctly in the
beginning are 1 in 1000, while the odds that you did not (and that the prize is in one of the other boxes)
is a near certain 999 in 1000.
