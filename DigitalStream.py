Project 20: Digital Stream: a scrolling screensaver that resembles The Matrix.
Experiment with different animation speeds.

This program minics the "digital stream" visualization from the science fiction movie
The Matrix. Random beads of binary "rain" stream up from the bottom of the screen, creating
a cool, hacker-like visualization. (Unfortunately, due to the way text moves as the screen
scrolls down, it's not possible to make the streams fall downward without using a module such
as bext.)
