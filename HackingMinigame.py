Project 33, Hacking Minigame: Deduce a password based on clues.
Add cosmetic features to make a basic game more interesting.

In this game, the player must hack a computer by guessing a seven-letter word used as the
secret password. The computer's memory banks display the possible words, and the player is
given hints as to how close each guess was. For example, if the secret password is MONITOR
but the player guessed CONTAIN, they are given the hint that two out of seven letters were
correct, because both MONITOR and CONTAIN have the letter O and N as their second and third
letter. This game is similar to Project 1, "Bagels", and the hacking minigame in the Fallout
series of video games.
