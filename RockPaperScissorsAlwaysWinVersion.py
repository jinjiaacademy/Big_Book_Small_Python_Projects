Project 60, Rock Paper Scissors (Always-Win Version): A version of the game where the player
cannot lose.
Create the illusion of randomness in a program.

This variant of Rock Paper Scissors is identical to Project 59, "Rock Paper Scissors",
except the player will always win. The code selecting the computer's move is set so that
it always chooses the losing move. You can offer this game to your friends, who may be excited
when they win... at first. See how long it takes before they catch on to the fact that the
game is rigged in their favor.
