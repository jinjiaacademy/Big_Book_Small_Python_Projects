Project 22, Ducklings: Mix and match strings to create a variety of ASCII-art ducks.
Use object-oriented programming to create a data model for duck drawings.

This program creates a scrolling field of ducklings. Each duckling has slight variations:
they can face left or right and have two different body sizes, four types of eyes, two types
of mouths, and three positions for their wings. This gives us 96 different possible variations,
which the Ducklings program produces endlessly.
