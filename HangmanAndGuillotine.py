Project 34, Hangman and Guillotine: The classic word guessing game.
Use string manipulation and ASCII art.

This classic word game has the player guess the letters to a secret word. For each
incorrect letter, another part of the hangman is drawn. Try to guess the complete
word before the hangman completes. The secret words in this version are all animals
like RABBIT and PIGEON, but you can replace these with your own set of words.
The HANGMAN_PICS variable contains ASCII-art strings of each step of the hangman's
noose.
For a French twist on the game, you can replace the strings in the HANGMAN_PICS variable
with the following strings depicting a guillotine.
