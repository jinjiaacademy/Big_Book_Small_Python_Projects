Project 77, Tower of Hanoi: The classic disk-stacking puzzle.
Use stack data structures to simulate a puzzle state.

The Tower of Hanoi is a stack-moving puzzle game that features three poles on which you can stack
various-sized disks. The object of the game is to move one tower of disks to another pole. However,
only one disk can be moved at a time, and larger disks cannot be placed on top of smaller ones.
Figuring out a certain pattern will help you solve this puzzle. Can you discover it? (Hint: try
setting the TOTAL_DISKS variable to 3 or 4 to solve an easier version first.)
