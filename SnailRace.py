Project 69, Snail Race: Fast-paced snail racing action!
Calculate spacing for ASCII art snails.

You won't be able to handle the fast-paced excitement of these racing ... snails.
But what they lack in speed they make up for in ASCII-art cuteness. Each snail (represtned by
an @ character for the shell and v for the two eyestalks) moves slowly but surely toward the
finish line. Up to eight snails, each with a custom name, can race each other, leaving a slime
trail in their wake. This program is good for beginners.
