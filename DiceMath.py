Project 17, Dice Math: A visual dice-rolling math game.
Use dictionary data structures for screen coordinates.

This math quiz program rolls two to six dice whose sides you must add up as quickly as
possible. But this program operates as more than just automated flash cards; it draws
the faces of the dice to random places on the screen. The ASCII-art aspect adds a fun
twist while you practice arithmetic.
