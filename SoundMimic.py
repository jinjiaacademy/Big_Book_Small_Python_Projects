Project 71, Sound Mimic: Memorize an increasingly long pattern of sounds.
Play sound files from a Python program.

Similar to the Simon electronic toy, this memorization game uses the third-party playsound
module to play four different sounds, which correspond to the A, S, D, and F keys on the keyboard.
As you successfully repeat the pattern the game gives you, the patterns get longer and longer.
How many sounds can you hold in your short-term memory?
If you look at the code, you'll see that the playsound.playsound() function is passed the filename
of the sound to play. You can download the sound files from these URLs:
    https://inventwithpython.com/soundA.wav
    https://inventwithpython.com/soundS.wav
    https://inventwithpython.com/soundD.wav
    https://inventwithpython.com/soundF.wav
Place these files in the same folder as soundmimic.py before running the program. More information
about the playsound module can be found at https://pypi.org/project/playsound/. Users on macOS must
also install the pyobjc module from https://pypi.org/project/pyobjc/ for playsound to work.
