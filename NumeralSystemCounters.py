Project 52, Numeral Systems Counters: Examine binary and hexadecimal numbers.
Use Python's number conversion functions.

We're used to counting in the decimal numeral system, which uses 10 digits: 0 through 9. This system
likely developed because humans counted on their fingers, and most people have 10 fingers. But other
number systems exist. Computers make use of binary, a numeral system with only two digits, 0 and 1.
Programmers also sometimes use hexadecimal, which is a base-16 numeral system that uses the digits
0 to 9 but also extends into the letters A to F.
We can represent any number in any numeral system, and this program displays a range of numbers in
decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.
