"""
Project 35, Hex Grid: Progammatically generate tiled ASCII art.
Use loops to make repeating text patterns.

This short program produces a tessellated image of a hexagonal grid, similar to chicken wire.
It shows that you don't need a lot of code to make something interesting. A slightly more
complicated variation of this program is Project 65, "Shining Carpet."
Note that this program uses raw strings, which prefix the opening quote with a lowercase r so
that the backslashes in the string aren't interpreted as escape characters.
