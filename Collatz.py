Project 12, Collatz Sequence: Explore the simplest impossible conjecture in mathematics.
Learn about the modulus operator.

The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n+1 problem, is the simplest impossible math problem.
(But don't worry, the program itself is easy enough for beginners.) From a starting number, n,
follow three rules to get the next number in the sequence:
    1. If n is even, the next number n is n/2.
    2. If n is odd, the next number n is n*3+1.
    3. If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.
It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that every starting number
eventually terminates at 1. More information about the Collatz sequence can be found at
