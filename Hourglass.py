Project 36, Hourglass: A simple physics engine for falling sand.
Simulate gravity and use collision detection.

This visualization program has a rough physics engine that simulates sand falling through
the small aperture of an hourglass. The sand piles up in the bottom half of the hourglass,
then the hourglass is turned over so the process repeats.
