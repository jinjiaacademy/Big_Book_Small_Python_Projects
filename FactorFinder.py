Project 24: Factor Finder: Find all the multiplicative factors of a number.
Use the modulus operator and Python's math module.

A number's factors are any two other numbers that, when multiplied with each other, produce
the number. For example, 2 x 13 = 26, so 2 and 13 are factors of 26. Also, 1 x 26 = 26, so 1
and 26 are also factors of 26. Therefore, we say that 26 has four factors: 1, 2, 13, and 26.
If a number only has two factors (1 and itself), we call that a prime number. Otherwise, we call
it a composite number. Use the factor finder to discover some new prime numbers. (Hint: Prime
numbers always end with an odd number that isn't 5.) You can also have the computer calculate
them with Project 56, "Prime Numbers."
The math for this program isn't too heavy, making it an ideal project for beginners.
