Project 57, Progress Bar: A sample progress bar animation to use in other programs.
Use the backspace-printing technique to create animations.

A progress bar is a visual element that shows how much of a task has been completed. Progress
bars are often used alongside downloading files or software installations. This project creates
a getProgressBar() function that returns a progress bar string based on the arguments passed to
it. It simulates a downloading file, but you can reuse the progress bar code in your own projects.
