Project 46, Million Dice Roll Statistics Simulator: Explore the probability results of
rolling a set of dice one million times.
Learn how computers crunch large quantities of numbers.

When you roll two six-sided dice, there's a 17 percent chance you'll roll a 7. That's
much better than the odds of rolling a 2: just 3 percent. That's because there's only
one combination of dice rolls that gives you 2 (the one that occurs when both dice roll
a 1), but many combinations add up to seven: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, and so on.
But what about when you roll three dice? Or four? Or 1000? You could mathematically
calculate the theoretical probabilities, or you can have the computer roll a number of
dice one million times to empirically figure them out. This program takes that latter
approach. In this program, you tell the computer to roll N dice one million times and
remember the results. It then displays the percentage chance of each sum.
This program does a massive amount of computation, but the computation itself isn't hard
to understand.
