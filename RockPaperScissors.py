Project 59, Rock Paper Scissors: The classic hand game for two players.
Implement basic game rules as a program.

In this version of the two-player hand game also known as Rochambeau or jan-ken-pon,
the player faces off against the computer. You can pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. This program adds some
brief pauses for suspense.
For a variation of this game, see Project 60, "Rock Paper Scissors (Always-Win Version)."
