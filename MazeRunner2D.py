Project 44, Maze Runner 2D: Try to escape a maze.
Read maze data from text files.

This two-dimensional maze runner shows the player a top-down, bird's-eye view fo a maze
file you create in a text editor, such as the IDE you use to write your .py files. Using
the WASD keys, the player can move up, left, down, and right, respectively, to navigate
the @ symbol toward the exit marked by the X character.
To make a maze file, open a text editor and create the following pattern. Don't type the
numbers along the top and left side, they are only there for reference
    123456789

    8# # # #E#

The # characters represent walls, the S marks the start, and the E marks the exit. The #
characters in bold represent walls that you can remove to form your maze. Don't remove the
walls at odd-numbered columns and odd-numbered rows, and don't remove the borders of the
maze. When you're done, save the maze as a .txt (text) file. It could look something like
this:
    #########
    #S    # #
    # ### # #
    # #   # #
    # ##### #
    #   #   #
    ### # # #
    #     #E#
    #########
Of course, this is a simple maze. You can make maze files of any size as long as they have an
odd number of rows and columns. Be sure it'll still fit on the screen, though. You can also
download maze files from https://invpy.com/mazes/
