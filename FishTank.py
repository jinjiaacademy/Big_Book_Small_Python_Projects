Project 27, Fish Tank: A colorful, animated ASCII-art fish tank.
Use screen coordinates, text colors, and data structures.

Watch your own virtual fish in a virtual fish tank, complete with air bubblers and
kelp plants. Each time you run the program, it randomly generates the fish using different
fish types and colors. Take a break and enjoy the calm serenity of this software aquarium,
or try programming in some virtual sharks to terrorize its inhabitants. You can't run this
program from your IDE or editor. This program uses the bext module and must be run from the
Command Prompt or Terminal in order to display correctly. More information about the bext
module can be found at https://pypi.org/project/Bext/
