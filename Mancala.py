Project 43, Mancala: The ancient two-player board game from Mesopotamia.
Use ASCII art and string templates to draw a board game.

The board game Mancala is at least 2000 years old, making it almost as old as Project 63,
"Royal Game of Ur." It is a "seed-sowing" game in which two players select pockets of seeds
to spread across the other pockets on the board while trying to collect as many in their
store as possible. There are several variants of this game across different cultures. The
name comes from the Arab word naqala, meaning "to move."
To play, grab the seeds from a pit on your side of the board and place one in each subsequent
pit, going counterclockwise and skipping your opponent's store. If your last seed lands in an
empty pit of yours, move the opposite pit's seeds into that pit. If the last placed seed is in
your store, you get a free turn.
The game ends when all of one player's pits are empty. The other player claims the remaining
seeds for their store, and the winner is the one with the most seeds. More information about
Mancala and its variants can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala
