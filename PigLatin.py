Project 54, Pig Latin: Translates English messages into lgpay Atinlay.
Use text parsing and string manipulation.

Pig Latin is a word game that transforms English words into a parody of Latin. In Pig Latin,
if a word begins with a consonant, the speaker removes this letter and puts it at the end, followed
by "ay". For example, "pig" becomes "igpay" and "latin" becomes "atinlay". Otherwise, if the word
begins with a vowel, the speaker simply adds "yay" to the end of it. For example, "elephant" becomes
"elephantyay" and "umbrella" becomes "umbrellayay".
