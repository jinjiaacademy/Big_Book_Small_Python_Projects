Project 76, Tic-Tac-Toe: The classic two-player board game of Xs and Os.
Create a data structure and helper functions.

Tic-tac-toe is a classic pencil-and-paper game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing
their X or O marks, trying to get three in a row. Most games of tic-tac-toe end in a tie, but it
is possible to outsmart your opponent if they're not careful.
