Project 58, Rainbow: A simple rainbow animation.
Create animation for beginners.

Rainbow is a simple program that shows a colorful rainbow traveling back and forth across the
screen. The program makes use of the fact that when new lines of text appear, the existing text
scrolls up, causing it to look like it's moving. This program is good for beginners, and it's
similar to Project 15, "Deep Cave."
