Project 79, Twenty Forty-Eight: A casual tile matching game.
Simulate gravity to make tiles "fall" in arbitrary directions.

Gabriele Cirulli, a web developer, invented the game 2048 in one weekend. It was inspired by Veewo
Studios' 1024 game, which in turn was inspired by Threes!, a game by the development team Sirvo.
In 2048, you must merge numbers on a 4x4 board to clear them from the screen. Two 2s merge into a 4,
two 4s merge into an 8, and so on. The game adds a new 2 to the board on each merging. The objective
is to reach 2048 before the entire board fills up.
