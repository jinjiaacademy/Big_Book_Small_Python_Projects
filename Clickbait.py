Project 11, Clickbait Headline Generator: A humorous headline generator for your content farm.
Practice string manipulation and text generation.

Our website needs to trick people into looking at advertisements! But coming up with creative,
original content is too hard. Luckily, with the clickbait headline generator, we can make a computer
come up with millions of outrageous fake headlines. They're all low quality, but readers don't seem
to mind. This program generates as many headlines as you need from a Mad Libs-style template.
There's a lot of text in this program for the headline templates, but the code itself is straight-
forward and suitable for beginners.
