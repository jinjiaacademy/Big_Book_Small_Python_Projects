Project 74, Text-to-Speech Talker: Make your computer talk to you!
Use your operating system's text-to-speech engine.

This program demonstrates the use of the pyttsx3 third-party module. Any message you enter will
be spoken out loud by your operating system's text-to-speech capabilities. Although computer-generated
speech is an incredibly complex branch of computer science, the pyttsx3 module provides an easy
interface for it, making this small program suitable for beginners. Once you've learned how to use
the module, you can add generated speech to your own programs.
More information about the pyttsx3 module can be found at https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/
