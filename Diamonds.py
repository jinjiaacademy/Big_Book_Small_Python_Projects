Project 16, Diamonds: An algorithm for drawing diamonds of various sizes.
Practice your pattern recognition skills to create drawing algorithms.

This program features a small algorithm for drawing ASCII-art diamonds of various sizes. It
contains functions for drawing either an outline or filled-in-style diamond of the size you
dictate. These functions are good practice for a beginner; try to understand the pattern behind
the diamond drawings as they increase in size.
