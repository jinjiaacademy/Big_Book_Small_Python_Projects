Project 15, Deep Cave: A tunnel animation that descends endlessly into the earth.
Use string replication and simple math.

This program is an animation of a deep cave that descends forever into the earth. Although
short, this program takes advantage of the scrolling nature of the computer screen to produce
an interesting and unending visualization, proof that it doesn't take much code to produce
something fun to watch. This program is similar to Project 58, "Rainbow."
