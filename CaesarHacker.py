"""
Project 7, Caesar Hacker: A program to decrypt Caesar cipher messages without the encryption key.
Implement a brute-force cryptanalysis algorithm.

This program can hack messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher from Project 6, even if you don't
know the key. There are only 26 possible keys for the Caesar cipher, so a computer can easily try
all possible decryptions and display the results to the user. Incryptography, we call this technique
a brute-force attack.
