Project 30, Four in a row: A board game where two players try to connect four tiles in a row.
Create a data structure that mimics grevity.

In this classic tile-dropping board game for two players, you must try to get four of your
tiles in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, while preventing your opponent from
doing the same. This program is similar to Connect Four.
