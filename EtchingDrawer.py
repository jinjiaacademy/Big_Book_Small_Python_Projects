Project 23, Etching Drawer: Move the cursor to create line drawings.
Work with screen coordinates and relative directional movements.

When you move a pen point around the screen with the WASD keys, the etching drawer forms
a picture by tracing a continuous line, like the Etch A Sketch toy. Let your artistic side
break out and see what images you can create. This program also lets you save your drawings
to a text file so you can print them out later. Plus, you can copy and paste the WASD movements
of other drawings into this program, like the WASD commands for the Hilbert Curve fractal
presented on line 6 to 14 of the source code.
