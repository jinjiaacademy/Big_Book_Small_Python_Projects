Project 56, Prime Numbers: Calculate prime numbers.
Learn math concepts and use Python's math module.

A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by one and itself. Prime numbers have
a variety of practical applications, but no algorithm can predict them; we must calculate them
one at a time. However, we do know that there is an infinite number of prime numbers to be discovered.
This program finds prime numbers through brute-force calculation. Its code is similar to Project 24,
"Factor Finder." (Another way to describe a prime number is that one and the number itself are its
only factors.) You  can find out more about prime numbers from
