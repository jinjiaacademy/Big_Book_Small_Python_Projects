Project 14, Countdown: A countdown timer with a seven-segment display.
Practice importing modules you create.

This program displays a digital timer that counts down to zero. Rather than render numeric
characters directly, the sevseg.py module from Project 64, "Seven-Segment Display Module",
generates the drawings for each digit. You must create this file before the Countdown program
can work. Then, set the countdown timer to any number of seconds, minutes, and hours you like.
This program is similar to Project 19, "Digital Clock."
