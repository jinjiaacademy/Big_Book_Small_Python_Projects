Project 19, Digital Clock: A clock with a calculator-like display.
Generate numbers that match information from the datetime module.

This program displays a digital clock with the current time. Rather than render numeric characters
directly, the sevseg.py module from Project 64, "Seven-Segment Display Module," generates the
drawings for each digit. This program is similar to Project 14, "Countdown".
