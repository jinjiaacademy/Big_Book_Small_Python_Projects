Project 61, ROT13 Cipher: The simplest cipher for encrypting and decrypting text.
Convert between letters and numbers to perform math on text.

The ROT13 cipher, one of the simplest encryption algorithms, stands for "rotate 13 spaces".
The cypher represents the letters A to Z as the numbers 0 to 25 in such a way that the encrypted
letter is 13 spaces from the plain-text letter: A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on. The encryption
process is identical to the decryption process, making it trivial to program. However, the encryption
is also trivial to break. Because of this, you'll most often find ROT13 used to conceal non-sensitive
information, such as spoilers or trivia answers, so it's not read unintentionally. More information
about the ROT13 cipher can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13.
