Project 18, Dice Roller: A tool for reading Dungeons & Dragons dice notation to generate
random numbers.
Parse text to identify key strings.

Dungeons & Dragons and other tabletop role-playing games use special dice that can have 4, 8,
10, 12, or even 20 sides. These games also have a specific notation for indicating which dice to
roll. For example, 3d6 means rolling three six-sided dice, while 1d10+2 means rolling one ten-sided
die and adding a two-point bonus to the roll. This program simulates this dice rolling, in case you
forgot to bring your own. It can also simulate rolling dice that don't physically exist, such as
a 38-sided die.
