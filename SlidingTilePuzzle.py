Project 68, Sliding Tile Puzzle: The classic four-by-four tile puzzle.
Employ a data structure to reflect the state of a game board.

This classic puzzle relies on a 4 x 4 board with 15 numbered tiles and one free space.
The objective is to slide the tiles until the numbers are in the correct order, going left
to right and top to bottom. Tiles can only slide; you're not allowed to directly pick them
up and rearrange them. Some versions of this puzzle toy feature scrambled images that form
a complete picture once solved.
