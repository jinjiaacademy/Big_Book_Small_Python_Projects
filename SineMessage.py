"""
Project 67, Sine Message: Display a scrolling wave message.
Use a trigonometry function for animation.

This program displays a message of the user's choice in a wavy pattern as the text scrolls up.
It accomplishes this effect with math.sin(), which implements the trigonometric sine wave function.
But even if you don't understand the math, this program is rather short and easy to copy.
