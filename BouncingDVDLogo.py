Project 5, Bouncing DVD Logo: Simulates the colorful bouncing DVD logo of decades past.
Work with coordinates and colorful text.

If you are of a certain age, you'll remember those ancient technological devices called
DVD players. When not playing DVDs, they would display a diagonally traveling DVD logo
that bounced off the edges of the screen. This program simulate this colorful DVD logo
by making it change direction each time it hits an edge. We'll also keep track of how many
times a logo hits a corner of the screen. This creates an interesting visual animation to
look at, especially for the magical moment when a logo lines up perfectly with a corner.

You can't run this program from your integrated development environment (IDE) or editor
because it uses the bext module. Therefore, it must be run from the command prompt or Terminal
in order to display correctly. You can find more information about the bext module at
https://pypi.org/project/bext/.
