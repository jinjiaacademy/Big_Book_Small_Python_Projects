Project 75, Three-Card Monte: The tricky fast-swapping card game that scammers play on tourists.
Manipulate a data structure based on random movements.

Three-card monte is a common scam played on gullible tourists and other easy marks.
Three playing cards, one of which is the “red lady” Queen of Hearts, are put facedown on a
cardboard box. The dealer quickly rearranges the cards and then asks the mark to pick the
Queen of Hearts. But the dealer can use all sorts of tricks to hide the card or otherwise cheat,
guaranteeing that the victim never wins. It’s also common for the dealer to have shills in the
crowd who secretly work with the dealer but pretend to win the game (to make the victim think they
too could win) or purposefully lose badly (to make the victim think they could do much better).
This program shows the three cards and then quickly describes a series of swaps. At the end,
it clears the screen, and the player must pick a card.
Can you keep up with the “red lady”? For the authentic three-card monte experience, you can enable
the cheat feature, which causes the player to always lose, even if they select the correct card.
