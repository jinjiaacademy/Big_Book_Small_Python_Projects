Project 40, Leetspeak: Translate English messages into |33t5p34]<.
Use text parsing and string manipulation.

There's no better way to demonstrate your mad hacker skills than by replacing letters
in your text with numbers: m4d h4x0r 5k1llz!!! This word program automatically converts
plain English into leetspeak, the coolest way to talk online. Or at least it was in 1993.
It takes a while to get used to, but with some practice, you'll eventually be able to read
leetspeak fluently. For example, 1t +@]<3s 4 w|-|1le +o
g37 |_|s3|) 70, b|_|+ y0u (an 3\/3nt|_|/-\lly r3a|) l33t$peak phl|_|3n+ly.
Leetspeak may be hard to read at first, but the program itself is simple and good for beginners.
