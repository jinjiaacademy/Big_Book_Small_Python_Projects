Project 9, Carrot in a Box: A silly bluffing game between two players.
Create ASCII art.

This is a simple and silly bluffing game for two human players. Each player has a box. One box
has a carrot in it, and each player wants to have the carrot. The first player looks in their
box and then tells the second player they either do or don't have the carrot. The second player
gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.
The ASCII art in the code makes typing this program take a while (though copying and pasting the
ASCII art can speed up the task), but this project is good for beginners because it is straight-
forward, with minimal looping and no defined functions.
