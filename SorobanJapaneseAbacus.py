Project 70, Soroban Japanese Abacus: A computer simulation of a pre-computer calculating tool.
Use string templates to create an ASCII-art counting tool.

An abacus, also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool used in many cultures long before
electronic calculators were invented. Figure 70-1 shows the Japanese form of the abacus, called
a soroban. Each wire represents a place in a positional numeral system, and the beads on the wire
represent the digit at that place. For example, a soroban with two beads moved over on the rightmost
wire and three beads moved over on the second-to-rightmost wire would represent the number 32. This
program simulates a soroban (The irony of using a computer to simulate a pre-computer computing tool
is not lost on me.)
Each column in the soroban represents a different digit. The rightmost column is the ones place,
the column to its left is the tens place, the column to the left of that is the hundreds place,
and so on. The Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, and P keys along the top of your keyboard can increase
the digit at their respective positions, while the A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, and ; keys will
decrease them. The beads on the virtual soroban will slide to reflect the current number. You can
also enter numbers directly.
The four beads below the horizontal divider are "earth" beads, and lifting them up against the divider
counts as 1 for that digit. The bead above the horizontal divider is a "heaven" bead, and pulling it
down against the divider counts as 5 for that digit, so pulling down one heaven bead and pulling up
three earth beads in the tens column represents the number 80. More information about abacuses and how
to use them can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus
