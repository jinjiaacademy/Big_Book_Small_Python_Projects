Project 65, Shining Carpet: Programmatically generate the carpet from The Shining.
Use loops to make repeating text patterns.

The Shining, a 1980 psychological horror film directed by Stanley Kubrick, takes place at the
haunted Overlook Hotel. The hotel carpet's hexagonal design bacame an iconic part of this famous
movie. The carpet features alternating and interlocking hexagons whose mesmerizing effect is well-
suited for such an unnerving film. The short program in this project, similar to Project 35, "Hex
Grid" prints this repetitive pattern on the screen.
Note that this program uses raw strings, which prefix the opening quote with a lowercase r, so that
the backslashes in the string aren't interpereted as escape characters.
