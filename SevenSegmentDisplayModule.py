Project 64, Seven-Segment Display Module: A display like those used in calculators and microwave ovens.
Create modules for use in other programs.

A seven-segment display is a type of LCD component used to display numbers in pocket calculators,
microwave ovens, and other small electornic devices. Through different combinations of seven line-
shaped segments in an LCD, a seven-segment display can represent the digits 0 through 9.
The benefit of this program is that other programs can import it as a module. Project 14, "Countdown"
and Project 19, "Digital Clock" import the sevseg.py file so they can use its getSevSegStr() function.
