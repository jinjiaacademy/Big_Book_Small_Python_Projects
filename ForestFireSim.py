Project 29, Forest Fire Sim: Simulate the spread of wildfires through a forest.
Create a simulation with adjustable parameters.

This simulation shows a forest whose trees are constantly growing and then being burned down.
On each step of the simulation, there is a 1 percent chance that a blank space grows into a
tree adn a 1 percent chance that a tree is struck by lightning and burns. Fires will spread
to adjacent trees, so a densely packed forest is more likely to suffer a larger fire than a
sparsely packed one. This simulation was inspired by Nicky Case's Emoji Sim at
