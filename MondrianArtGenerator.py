Project 47, Mondrian Art Generator: Create geometric drawings in the style of Piet Mondrian
Implement an art-generating algorithm.

Piet Mondrian was a 20th-century Dutch painter and one of the founders of neoplasticism, an
abstract art movement. His most iconic paintings relied on blocks of primary colors (blue,
yellow, red), black, and white. Using a minimalist approach, he separated these colors with
horizontal and vertical elements.
This program generates random paintings that follow Mondrian's style. You can find out more
