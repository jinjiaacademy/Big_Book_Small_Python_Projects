Project 10: Cho-han: A gambling dice game from feudal Japan.
Practice using random numbers and dictionary data structures.

Cho-han is a dice game played in gambling houses of feudal Japan. Two six-sided dice are rolled
in a cup, and gamblers must guess if the sum is even (cho) or odd (han). The house takes a small
cut of all winnings. The simple random number generation and basic math used to determine odd or
even sums make this project especially suitable for beginners. More information about Cho-han can
be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%8D-han.
