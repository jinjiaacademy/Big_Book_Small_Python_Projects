Project 53, Periodic Table of the Elements: An interactive database of chemical elements.
Parse CSV files to load data into a program.

The periodic table of the elements organizes all known chemical elements into a single table.
This program presents this table and lets the player access additional information about each
element, such as its atomic number, symbol, melting point, and so on. I compiled this information
from Wikipedia and stored it in a file called periodictable.csv that you can download from
https://inventwithpython.com/periodictable.csv.
