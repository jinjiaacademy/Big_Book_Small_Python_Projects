Project 28, Flooder: Attempt to fill the entire puzzle board with one color.
Implement the flood fill algorithm.

Flooder is a colorful game where a player tries to fill the board with a single color
by changing the color of the tile in the upper-left corner. This new color spreads to
all neighboring tiles that matched the original color. It's similar to the Flood It
mobile game. This program also has a  colorblind mode, which uses shapes instead of flat
colored tiles. It relies on the recursive flood fill algorithm to paint the board and
works similarly to the "paint bucket" or "fill" tool in many painting applications.
