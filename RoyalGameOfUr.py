Project 63, Royal Game of Ur: A 5000-year-old game from Mesopotamia.
Use ASCII art and string templates to draw a board game.

The Royal Game of Ur is a 5000-year-old game from Mesopotamia. Archeologists rediscovered the
game in the Royal Cemetery at Ur, in modern-day southern Iraq, during excavations between 1922
and 1934. The rules were reconstructed from the game board (shwon in Figure 63-1) and a Babylonian
clay tablet, and they're similar to Parcheesi. You'll need both luck and skill to win.
Two players each begin with seven tokens in their home, and the first player to move all seven to
the goal is the winner. Players take turns throwing four dice. These dice are four-pointed pyramid
shapes called tetrahedrons. Each die has two marked points, giving an even chance that the dice
come up marked or unmarked. Instead of dice, our game uses coins whose heads act as the marked point.
The player can move a token one space for each marked point that comes up. This means they can move
a single token between zero and four spaces, though they're most likely to roll two spaces.
The tokens travel along the path indicated in Figure 63-2. Only one token may exist on a space at a
time. If a token lands on an opponent's token while in the shared middle path, the opponent's token
is sent back home. If a token lands on the middle flower square, it is safe from being landed on. If
a token lands on any of the other four flower tiles, the player gets to roll again. Our game will
represent the token with the letters X and O.
