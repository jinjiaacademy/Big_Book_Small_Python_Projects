"""
Project 42, Magic Fortune Ball: A program to answer your yes/no questions about the future.
Add cosmetic features to make basic text appear more interesting.

The Magic Fortune Ball can predict the future and answer your yes/no questions with 100 percent
accuracy using the power of Python's random number module. This program is similar to a Magic 8
Ball toy, except you don't have to shake it. It also features a function for slowly printing text
strings with spaces in between each character, giving the messages a spooky, mysterious effect.
Most of the code is dedicated to setting the eerie atmosphere. The program itself simply selects
a message to display in response to a random number.
